# Components

For this and the coming exercises, you can proceed with the same project. Make a copy or a new branch for each exercise, so you can look back later on.
There is a start project provided for your convenience. We'll learn later how you can create this yourself.

## Project

Have a look at the project. (There is a lot already in there)

We will focus on the `App.jsx` file for now. You can see that we have a component called `App` that returns a `article` with some content in it.
The goal for this exercise is to separate this component into smaller components.

- Create a new component (in the same App.jsx file) called `Bio` which contain the `<p>I live in...</p>` and use this component in the `App` component.
- Create a new component called `Meals` which contains the entire `article` tag. Use this component in the `App` component.
